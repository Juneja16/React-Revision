1..React Element Creation with the Help of Jsx i.e 
const reactHeading = <h1 className="heading1">Hello React First code</h1>;

2. If only one HTML Tag then a single line else enclose it in the Fragment 
const reactHeading = <>
                <h1 className="heading1">Hello React First code</h1>;
                <h1 className="heading1">Hello React Second code</h1>;
                    <>

3. React is SPA i.e only Single HTML File will be loaded in the Browser on Starting From Web Server and thats it 
Rest the site will change on Interaction . only Changing in Respective Components with the Help of Routing and all 
Hence Makes it Faster 

While React is often used for SPAs, it can also be used in:
1.Static sites (with Gatsby/Next.js)
2.Server-rendered apps (with Next.js)
3.Mobile apps (React Native)

4.Virtual Dom vs Browser Dom

In React , with taking the help of Virtual Dom it just replaces the updated copy of DOM Tree with the Original 
DOM Tree.

Browser DOM: Imagine rewriting a 500-page book every time you change one word.
Virtual DOM: You make a copy of the book, highlight the one word that changed, 
then replace only that word in the original book.

Why Virtual DOM Feels Faster
1.Batching: React groups many updates together instead of doing them one by one.
2.Diffing algorithm: Finds the smallest set of DOM changes.
3.Minimal reflows: Browser only recalculates layout for changed parts.
4.Memory-first updates: Most work happens in JavaScript memory, not in the heavy DOM engine.

5. <script language="javaScript">
heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(heading);
</script>


Main Element is Rendered on Root . Rest all are created inside Main element.
root.render(element, container element);

6. AND (first falsy or last truthy)
Koi bhi falsy value miljaye mein vo return kardunga (Bina idhar udhar Dekhe)
Varna agar koi bhi value false nahi hai toh last truthy value return kardunga

OR (first truthy or last falsy)
koi bhi truthy value miljaye return kardunga (thats my task to represent truth asap)
varna agar koi truty nahi mili toh last falsy value return kar dunga 

JSX elements are considered truthy value 


Only 7 values are falsy:
1.false
2.0 (zero)
3.-0 (negative zero)
4.0n (BigInt zero)
5."" (empty string)
6.null
7.undefined
8.NaN

(That’s it — everything else is truthy, even things like "0", "false", [], {}, etc.)
