<!--  Here App Component is a Controlled Component as the value of input is
controlled by React State (name). onchange changes the state immediately as user
changes the input value. Now that is being visible through {name} rendering in
h1 tag. But on submit, we are updating the state to a new value.to show that
state can be updated programmatically too and that too what the developer wants.


This is better than using useRef as in previous example because there the value
of input was not being controlled by React State. So if we wanted to change the
value of input we could not do that directly. We had to change the value of the
ref.current which is not the recommended way in React.  -->



<!-- When to use what?
1. Controlled (state + onChange) → recommended for most forms (clean, React-driven).

2. Uncontrolled (ref) → useful when:

You don’t need to update the UI as user types.

Performance matters (lots of inputs).

File inputs (since they can’t be controlled easily). -->
